# Button-Clicked-Website
Full-stack web application that allows users to login with their credentials and click on a button on screen. 
A MySQL server keeps track of how many times the user has clicked the button and displays the count on screen.
When a user logs out, the button clicked count is stored in the SQL server and is saved for the next time the user logs back in.
